### Cats vs Dogs
This project is implemented using keras api. This project shows how you can use keras to implement a CNN to classify between Cats and Dogs. 

This was supposed to be implemented fast.ai way but since my PC doesn't have Nvidia graphic card and don't have money to rent a cloud service so I did this project my way using keras.

#### Dependencies:
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Sk learn} (https://scikit-learn.org/)
* [Keras] (https://keras.io/)

#### This Notebook will show examples of:

*	How to use a part of dataset to train your model if your machine can't handle the load.
*	Data handling.
*   Importing Data from zip file.
*	Split the training data into train, dev sets.
*	Visualization of data.
*	how to build a CNN for image classification.
*	Visualization of test dataset with predicted labels.
