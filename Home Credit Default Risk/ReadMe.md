### Home Credit Default Risk
This is a Project in an IPython Notebook for the Kaggle competition Home Credit Default Risk. 
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. 
The goal of this project is to build a model capable of identifying whether a client can repay loan or not.
