### Kaggle-Digit Recognizer
This is a Project in an IPython Notebook for the Kaggle competition, Digit Recognizer. The goal of this repository is to show how you can build a state of the art Neural Network from scratch and use it in multiclass classification like degit recognization.


#### Dependencies:
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [SciKit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)


### Kaggle Competition | Digit Recognizer

>Competition Description
>MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. 
>Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. 
>As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

>In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. 
>We’ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. 
>We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.

### Goal for this Notebook:

*	The goal is to show how you can build deep neural networks from scratch for Image classification purposes without any popular framework like [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) or [Keras](https://www.keras.io).
*	This notebook shows how you can increase the efficiency of your Neural Network and how to handle with Bias and Variance problems.

#### This Notebook will show examples of:

*	Data handling
*   Importing Data with Pandas
*   Cleaning Data
*   Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib
*   How to make a Neural Network from scratch.
*	How to deal with bias and variance problems.
*	How to choose your NN architecture.
*	How to use your model on a completely new dataset to see how well this model does.
